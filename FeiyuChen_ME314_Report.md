# Introduction
It can be a big headache to hard code the simulation of multi-link system in Mathematica, as it's trivial to type in all formulas and easier to produce bugs. The goal of this project is to reduce such pain by wrapping up an API (Application Programming Interface) so that the user could do the simulation by several simple functions.


## 1. 5 bianxing Triangle
The first link has 3 DOF. The second and the third link are fixed, so 0 DOF.


knowledge: 3DOF, WALL, WALL

## 2. flying link
knowldge, Fixed point, 1DOF, 1DOF, 1DOF

## 3. fixed link with constraint


## walls

WALL, WALL,
