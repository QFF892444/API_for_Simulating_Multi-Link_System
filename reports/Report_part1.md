# Report of ME314 Final Project
# Part 1
# Simulating Multi-link System
## Feiyu Chen

This is the 1st part of my report. I will describe my simulation scene, coordinates of objects, calculation of Euler-Lagrange equations and impacts, etc. 

More details about how I generalized my code for creating multi-link system are put in the Report_part2.pdf.

## 1. Proposal

My original proposal was to simulate "a two-link pendulum playing triangular ping-pong against walls" (without user input, just motion and impacts). 

However, as I was doing this project, I found it too troublesome to hardcode all the variables, equations, and impacts. So I wrote an API (several encapsulated functions) for creating links (see **Report_part2.pdf**), and then I simulated a multi-link system with 8 DOF, as seen in the image below.

## 2. Figure of the Scene  

The above figure shows my simulation scene as well as annotations of the coordinates and transformations.   

There are 5 groups of links in the figure:   
1. A pentagon (DOF=3)  
2. A 2-link pendulum (DOF=2)  
3. A 1-link pendulum (DOF=3, height of the left vertex is fixed)  
4. A 1-link wall (DOF=0)  
5. Four walls around the main objects (DOF=0)  

The x and y axis of each frame are denoted by straight arrows. There are 3 types of frames:    
* <span style="color:red"> *Red frame* </span> is for 3-DOF link that has variables $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$, and $\mathbf{theta}$.    
* <span style="color:green"> *Green frame* </span> is for 1-DOF link, which has variable $\mathbf{theta}$ and can rotate around a certain pivot.    
* <span style="color:gray"> *Gray frame* </span> is for 0-DOF link, whose two vertices are fixed in a certain frame.  

The transformations between different frames are denoted by curved arrows in <span style="color:blue"> blue</span>. These transformations connect up several links to form an object.  

## 3. Calculation of EL-eqs and Impacts

### 3.1 KE-V  
Suppose a link has length $\mathbf{l}$. Then I assume its mass to be $\mathbf{l}$ and inertia to be $\mathbf{l^2}$. The generalized 6x6 body mass M is then obtained.  

For each link, I compute the 4x4 matrix representation $\mathbf{g}$ of its center frame. Then calculate the body screw velocity $\mathbf{V}$ using $\mathbf{g}$ and $\mathbf{dg/dt}$. Then the kinetic energy is $\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{V^T M V}$.  

### 3.2 Constraint and External Force  

There is no external force in my simulation. But it's easy to add -- simply put something on the right side of EL-eqs.  

I added one constraint to the 1-link pendulum on the right-up side of the figure. I first computed the {x,y} coords of its left vertex, and then set $\mathbf{y}$ as 0. Then I passed it to the EL-eqs.  

### 3.3 Detecting Impacts
In my simulation, the impact only happens between a vertex and an edge. An impact happens when:   
1. The vertex has a very small distance to the edge.   
2. The projection from vertex to edge is on the edge.   

I detect the impact by checking these two criteria.  

### 3.4 Impact Update  
After detecting one or more impacts, my NDSolve breaks up. Then I do the impact updates for all the impacts one by one, get the new $\mathbf{dq}$, and call the NDSolve again.  

The logic of my code for impact detection  looks like this:  

```
Loop{
   While(no impact && t!=t_end{
       NDSolve
   }
   if(impacts){
       impact update for each impact
   }else{
       break
   }
}
```

## 4. Result  
### 4.1 How to run  
To get the simulation result, please open "run_this.nb" and run its cells one by one.  

The code will open another three "funcs_xxx.nb", load the functions, and computes the linksâ€™ motions. It takes about 3 minutes to compute for 15 seconds simulation.  

The video I recorded is in "scene1.mp4".  

### 4.2 What happens in simulation  
In my simulation, the pentagon and 2-link pendulum are moving and sometimes impacting with each other. The 1-link pendulum on the right-up side is just for showing that my "Constraint" is working.

### 4.3 Hamiltonian   
Since the energy of my system is supposed to be conserved, I plot the Hamiltonian as seen below. It does conserve over time.

## 5 Problems  

### 5.1 Fail to detect some impacts    
Sometimes, one link will stick into the surface of the polygon.  

**Guess 1:** Need smaller integration step  
   I tried to use NDSolve's EventLocator's multi-event function, but failed (I couldn't put a list variable there). So I manually code the function of detecting multiple impacts. Its problem is, if I detect an impact at time i, I need to silence it in time i+1, and then it can detect impacts later. Thus, the only case of not detecting impact that I can image is the vertex go through the edge in 2 integration step. (If using EventLocator's multi-event, the special case would be 1 integration step.)

**Guess 2:** Maybe multi impacts at the same time is also a cause for the problem. But I don't know if there is such logical error in my code.

**Solution 1:** Decreasing the integral step length (but at a cost of larger computation time).

**Solution 2:** Use the sign of distance instead of threshold  
May be I can solve the problem by detecting the change of sign of the distance to know if a vertex goes through the edge. But its impact criteria would be a little bit more complex than before, and I'm still worrying about the edge cases. I'll try it next time.


### 5.2 Weird Error about Imaginary Number
Occationally I get such an error:   
> LessEqual::nord: Invalid comparison with -0.977809-1.74032*10^-19 I attempted.  

I have no idea why my calculation suddenly generates this imaginary number. I tried Re[] and Chop[] to chop out the small imaginary number, but still not thoroughly fix this bug.  

When it happens, what I did is to random the velocity and run another simulation.
